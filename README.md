# Description
In this assignment, you will perform a rudimentary sentiment analysis on movie reviews using Spark. The data contains 2000 files with movie reviews and a set of positive and negative words. You need to assign a sentiment to each movie review, i.e. either positive or negative (for each file in the movie review dataset) based on the frequency of the positive and negative words.

1.Positive words: happy, joy, excited, elated
2.Negative words: sad, bad, unhappy, pity
3.Sample Review: I was excited to see this movie. Although the movie had a sad story but had a happy ending
4.Positive score: 2 (excited, happy)
5.Negative score: 1 (sad)
6.Final sentiment: positive
